		<h2>Conor Joseph is a fine jewellery designer based in London.</h2>
		<p>Whilst studying jewellery design at Central Saint Martins College of Art, Conor was able to explore and take inspiration from an array of inter-disciplines such as film, visual art and sculpture to form unique pieces of jewellery, which he now makes in Londonâ€™s historical jewellery epicentre, Hatton Garden.<br>
		Prevailing themes in his work include otherness, fetishism and the macabre. Human form is also an evident influence throughout his practice and many interpret his works to be an extension of the body. The darkness of his designs juxtaposes the classically British Craftsmanship, to produce beautifully unique constructed items of fine contemporary jewellery.<br><br>
		Conor has recently worked with fashion designer Christopher Shannon for his A/W16 menswear collection, and continues to work both on his own independent practice and alongside other designers in collaboration.</p>
